*\*BYOK (Bring Your Own Key): These tools act as clients and require you to provide your own API key from a model provider.*
*\*\*Usage-based: These APIs typically offer a small amount of free credits, after which the cost is based on usage (pay-as-you-go).*

## Free API Providers

### Gemini API

The free tier allows you to use the *Gemini-2.5-Pro* make **5 requests per minutes, and 100 requests

## API Bridges and Proxies

### Compatibility Bridges

Most AI tools support OpenAI-compatible APIs. For tools requiring Anthropic-compatible APIs, these bridges help:

#### Claude Code Router
- **[Claude Code Router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router)** - Routes Claude Code requests to different models with request customization

#### Copilot API Bridge
- **[copilot-api](https://github.com/ericc-ch/copilot-api)** - Converts GitHub Copilot into OpenAI/Anthropic API compatible server for use with Claude Code

**Deployment Example (Singularity/CVMFS)**:
The `copilot-api` tool is available in the modern-linuxtools Singularity image on CVMFS:

```bash
# Setup the environment
$ source /cvmfs/atlas.sdcc.bnl.gov/users/yesw/singularity/alma9-x86/modern-linuxtools/setupMe.sh

# Start the API wrapper
$ copilot-api start -c
[...]
  âžœ Listening on: http://130.199.48.146:4141/

# In another terminal, use with Aider
$ export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://130.199.48.146:4141 && aider --no-git --anthropic-api-key dummy --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

# Or use with Claude Code CLI (also included in modern-linuxtools)
$ export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://130.199.48.146:4141 && claude-code
```

**Important Notes**:
- Use your own URL in the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` environment variable and remove the trailing '/'
- Enable X11 forwarding when SSH-ing to remote hosts (required by xsel in the wrapper): `ssh -X username@hostname`
- With this API wrapper, all GitHub Copilot models (not including the Market models) become accessible through Claude Code CLI

## Usage Guides

### Getting Started
1. Choose a tool based on your needs (general chat vs. code assistance)
2. Set up API keys for your preferred provider
3. Install the CLI tool using the provider's instructions
4. Configure authentication and start using

### Best Practices
- Use code-focused tools for programming tasks
- Leverage free APIs for experimentation
- Consider local models for privacy-sensitive work
- Use API bridges to integrate different tools
